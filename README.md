# Version-55 Cruiser

A faithful recreation of the early Version-55 Company Cruiser.

- Not the V70 tank.
- Not the flying exploit machine.

## The original vision - fragile, clunky, and most likely run-ending

 - Retains as much of the original jank as possible.
 - Removes the absurd mobility abuse.
 - ...Adds a random chance for the Cruiser to be right-hand-drive.
 - Polished, but never 'perfected'.

It is garbage on wheels.

It is beautiful.


* Enjoy.
