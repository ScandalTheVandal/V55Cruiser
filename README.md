# Version-55 Cruiser

A faithful recreation of the early Version-55 Company Cruiser.

Issued without apology.

You really don't "get the Cruiser" in present times.

## What to expect:

- Poor handling characteristics.
- A spike in stress when operating this hunk of junk.
- Ended runs due to vehicle destruction.
- Fire, lots of fire.
- Frequent regret
- Structural rigidity similar to that of paper machete


## This is the original vision - fragile, clunky, lethal to use.

- Not the V70 tank.
- Not the flying exploit machine.


## This mod:

 - Retains as much of the original jank as possible.
 - Removes the absurd mobility abuse.
 - Increases vulnerability ten fold. You were never meant to be safe. You are a underpaid meat sack operating a "company approved" transporation machine. Don't have high hopes.
 - ...Adds a random chance for the Cruiser to be right-hand-drive.
 - Adds minor polish where deemed necessary. Does not 'improve' using this hunk of metal.

It is garbage on wheels.

It is beautiful.

It is, the Cruiser.

## And as Zeekerss once proudly said:

"If you get the Company Cruiser, you get Lethal Company".


# Enjoy.
