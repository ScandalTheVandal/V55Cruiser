# Version-55 Cruiser

A faithful recreation of the early Version-55 Company Cruiser.

Issued without apology.

You really, really don't "get the Cruiser" in present times. You think you do, you don't. 

## What to expect:

- Poor handling characteristics.
- A spike in stress when operating this hunk of junk.
- Ended runs as a result of this dumpster fire death trap.
- Fire, lots of fire.
- Frequent regret.
- Structural rigidity similar to that of paper machete.
- Death, lots and lots of death.


## This is the original vision - fragile, clunky, lethal to use.

- Not the indestructible V70 tank.
- Not the over-glorified and over-powered Jetpack in the shape of a Truck.


- This is THE Company Cruiser.
- Difficult to control.
- Made to be driven. Not flied.
  

## This mod:

 - Retains as much of the original jank as possible.
 - Removes the absolutely devastating ability to fly the car. This ability single-handedly drained any fun out of the car and is the complete antithesis of the point of the car.
 - Increases vulnerability ten fold. You were never meant to be safe. You are a underpaid meat sack operating a "company approved" transporation machine. Don't have high hopes.
 - ...adds a random chance for the Cruiser to be right-hand-drive. Because I can, and there's nothing you can do about it.
 - Adds minor polish where deemed necessary. Does not neccessarily 'improve' the usability of this hunk of metal.


This thing "does anything but cruise"

It is garbage on wheels.

It is beautiful.

It is "The Cruiser."

## And as Zeekerss once proudly said:

"If you get the Company Cruiser, you get Lethal Company".


# Enjoy.
