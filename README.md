# Version-55 Cruiser

A faithful recreation of the early Version-55 Company Cruiser.

- Not the V70 tank.
- Not the flying exploit machine.

## The original vision - fragile, clunky, and most likely run-ending

 - Retains as much of the original jank as possible.
 - Removes the absurd mobility abuse.
 - Increased vulnerability, you were never meant to be safe.
 - ...Adds a random chance for the Cruiser to be right-hand-drive.
 - Polished, but never 'perfected'.

It is garbage on wheels.

It is beautiful.

## And as Zeekerss once proudly said:

"If you get the Company Cruiser, you get Lethal Company".


# Enjoy.
